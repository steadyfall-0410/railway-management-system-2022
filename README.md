# Railway Reservation Management System
A railway reservation management system made for a school project in Grade 12 using Python as the front-end platform and MySQL for the back-end platform.

## → ABOUT
The aim of this project is to design and develop a database maintaining records of different trains, train status and passengers. It contains a simple railways reservation management system, which facilitates the passengers to book or cancel a train reservation, make inquiries about the trains available based on source and destination, status of the booked ticket, etc.        
<br>
## → LANGUAGES
- Python
- SQL

<br>

### \* **NOTE** \*
The program might be bulky and unreadable since I have used variables of my convenience and the function methods might be unefficient. It has also come to my light that I am unnecessarily using up bytes in the MySQL database.
\
\
A new branch called `efficient` is made, if you want to check out the updated code. 
\
\
Plans for the future : 
- Use *tkinter* module to make a neat GUI
- Use *matplotlib* module to show graphs for varying prices of trains

You are free to add any modifications to this code or suggest me any ideas to enhance it. ❤
